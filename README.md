# Memorization Recipe

## 1. Make it work.
* Visualize the problem as a tree 
* Implement the tree using recursion
* Test it

## 2. Make it efficient 
* Add a memo object
* Add a base case to return memo values
* Store return values into the memo

# Tabulation Recipe

* visualize the problem as a table 
* size the table based on the inputs
* initialize the table with default values
* seed the trivial answer into the table
* iterate through the table
* fill further positions based on the current position
